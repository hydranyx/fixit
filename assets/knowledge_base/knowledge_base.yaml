  ## Basic Advice
  - atom:
      text: callTuner
    text: The advice is to call a tuner.
  - atom:
      text: callTechnician
    text: The advise is to call a piano technician because simply a tuning will not fix the problem. Someone only equipped and hired to tune is not able to improve the situation.
  - atom:
      text: callSalesman
    text: "Your piano is old and the quality decreased to such a degree that the best advice is to sell the instrument or donate it to a good cause that does not care about the bad sound. The advice is to get an opinion on the remaining worth of the instrument, by an expert in sales of pianos"
  - atom:
      text: generalRepair
    text: Your instrument is old but of a valuable type. Call a technician to get an opinion on whether it is worth doing a general repair on the piano

  ## Out of Tune Advice
  - atom:
      text: climateSystem
    text: You have a valuable instrument that would benefit from a climate system because the reason your piano is out of tune is the climate change that it has recently been through. A climate system is about 650 EUR.
  - atom:
      text: humidifier
    text: The room the instrument resides in is too dry. Your instrument can benefit from a humidifier. A humidifier costs about 150 EUR.
  - atom:
      text: waterBottle
    text: "The room your instrument resides in is too dry. Open the lower lid of your piano and inside the piano, mostly on the right there is space to place 1 or more open bottles filled with water. This will humidify the inside of the piano. Check after a period whether you need to refill the bottles with more water."
  - atom:
      text: acclimatize
    text: You need to acclimatize the instrument for about 2 weeks since it recently has been through an environmental change of circumstances. After this normalization your piano probably still is out of tune so advised it is to call a tuner.
  - atom:
      text: airDeHumidifiers
    text: The air in the room is too humid. If it is not possible to relocate the piano in a less humid room one is advised to find a way to make the room less humid. The quality of the piano will probably decrease if the circumstances of the environment do not change. Simple tuning the piano will not solve the problem because in a short period the piano will be out of tune again. A possible decrease for the problem would be to get air dehumidifiers for the room.
  - atom:
      text: naturalDamage
    text: "The piano has been damaged by either water, mold, rust, moths or mice and this is noticeably a problem. The repairs can only been done by a piano technician so the advise is to call one."

  ## Uneven Key Sounds Advice
  - atom:
      text: hangingDampers
    text: There is a legitimate reason to believe that the problem is that your instrument has hanging dampers. The advise is to call a piano technician.
  - atom:
      text: pedalSettingUpright
    text: "It was the setting of the pedal. Congratulations, you fixed the problem yourself"
  - atom:
      text: pedalSettingGrand
    text: "The problem is most likely the pedal setting. If you can see a regulation bolt at the end of the piano rod, try to turn it clockwise and check the results of the adjustments. If a few clockwise twists do not resolve the complaints you need a technician to help adjust the settings. So the final advice is to call a technician."

  ## Uneven Key Feel Advice
  - atom:
      text: selfFixReBushing
    text: Congratulations you fixed the problem by resolving the friction! However if the problem returns call a technician.
  - atom:
      text: reBushing
    text: The instructions did not help. The problem of the friction in the key can only be resolved by re-bushing the piano and for that you need a piano technician. Call one.
  - atom:
      text: PTD
    text: The problem seems to be all about the touch being an unfortunate feel. The solution to clear that up would be to perform a Precision Touch Design or PTD however not all technicians are able to perform such an operation. Try to find a technician who can.

  ## Uneven key feel and key sound advice
  - atom:
      text: touchingHammers
    text: The diagnose is that hammers are touching. The advise is to call a technician to fix the hammering.
  - atom:
      text: rePinning

  - atom:
      text: brokenAndMissingDampers
    text: "The damper's are or damper is broken and possibly missing. there need to be replacements for the damaged parts and this can only be done by a piano technician. The advice is to contact one."
  - atom:
      text: regulationOfTheAction
    text: After ruling out that it might be a caused by damper or pedal failures there is a good chance that the complaint is caused by ??? Call a piano technician to fix the regulation of the action.
